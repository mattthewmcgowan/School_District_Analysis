# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis: 
The purpose of the school district analysis is to take a deeper look at a few key metrics such as, average score, passing percentage, school funding, and school type just to name a few. After consolidating all the school district data into a single data frame we were able to analysis the effects those variable had on school performance. 

- School District Summary

As seen below, when we omit the 9th graders from the student count and reduce the school averages there is little affect to the overall percentages of the district.This is most likely because the Thomas High School 9th grade population is such a small proportion of the district itself.

- School Summary 

Again, we see minute changes in the data when comparing school summaries before the Thomas High School 9th graders area counted and when they are ommitted. 
    - For example, The Overal passing percentage for Thomas High was 90.95%. After the overall passing percentage is 90.63%.

## Summary

A few changes that occured when we replaced the math and reading schools for Thomas High School were that there are sligh decreases in overall passing percentage. This would lead me to believe that 10-12th grade students keep high overall grades. Thomas High School still remains the second best performing school with an entire class ommitted. This would reenforce my first belief that the student at Thomas High are top performers. The same is true for the math and reading scores overall. There was slight decreases in overal math and reading percentage. But not enough to cause futher investigation.
